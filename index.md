## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Dept. of Pediatrics, UC San Diego. My PI is [Dr. Eniko Sajti](https://pediatrics.ucsd.edu/research/faculty-labs/sajti-lab/index.html). I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Shu Chien-Gene Lay
Department of Bioengineering](https://be.ucsd.edu/) in UCSD from September 2021 to June 2024.

I received my Ph.D. in Biology with a Specialization in Bioinformatics from Sun Yat-Sen University under the supervision of Dr. Chung-I Wu (2021). I received my bachelor’s degree in the School of Biomedical Engineering at Southern Medical University (2010). Both two universities are located in Guangzhou.

I was born and raised in a Teochew family. Here is a [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_people) about Teochew people (潮州人/潮汕人) and our culture.

## Research Interests

- **Medical genomics:**  
  immune checkpoint receptor signaling  
  innate immunity  
- **Evolutionary genomics:**    
  the role of microRNA in gene expression evolution.  
  genetic incompatibiliy - for example, disease-associated amino acid residues in one species could be the wild-type in another species.
