## About Me

I have been a postdoctoral researcher in [Dr. Eniko Sajti](https://pediatrics.ucsd.edu/research/faculty-labs/sajti-lab/index.html)'s lab at the Department of Pediatrics, UC San Diego, since July 2024. Before joining the Sajti lab, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Bioengineering at UCSD from September 2021 to June 2024.

I received my Ph.D. in Biology with a Specialization in Bioinformatics from Sun Yat-Sen University under the supervision of [Dr. Chung-I Wu](https://x.com/OfficialSMBE/status/1938222778014175378) (July 2014 - June 2021). I received my bachelor’s degree in the School of Biomedical Engineering at Southern Medical University (Sep 2006 - June 2010). Both universities are located in Guangzhou.

I was born and raised in a Teochew family (data not shown). Here is a [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_people) about Teochew people (潮州人/潮汕人) and our culture.

## Research Interests

- **Medical genomics:**  
  * immune checkpoint receptor signaling  
  * innate immunity  
- **Evolutionary genomics:**    
  * the role of microRNA in gene expression evolution (part of my Ph.D. thesis).  
  * genetic incompatibiliy - for example, disease-associated amino acid residues in one species could be the wild-type in another species.
